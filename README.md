This is a personal project I made for fun.

A simple and fun "Guess the Number" game built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is just a little project of mine and is purely for fun!

## How It Works

- The game randomly generates a number between a specified number you set.
- The player tries to guess the number, and the game provides feedback whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.
- It will then display the number of attempts.


## Features

- **Customizable Range**: Players can set the minimum and maximum number range before starting the game by clicking the "Set" button.
- **Random Number Generation**: The game generates a random number within the specified range only after the player sets the min and max values.
- **Feedback on Guesses**: Players receive feedback on their guesses, indicating whether the guess is too high or too low.
- **Winning Condition**: The player wins by correctly guessing the number, and a success message is displayed.


## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the game interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the game elements.
- **JavaScript**: For adding the game logic and handling player interactions.
